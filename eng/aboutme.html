        <h3>
            I'm Gabriel Felipe Majeau Lopes, but most people call me Maju. From an early age, I developed a strong sense
            of responsibility and a growing passion for technology. </br></br>In 2022, I began studying Computer Science with a
            full scholarship at PUC. That’s when I discovered my love for development, especially frontend, where
            creativity and logic come together. </br></br>Since then, I’ve been focused on learning and growing as a developer.

        <h2>My <span class="palavra">job</span></h2>
        <h3>From a young age, I’ve worked in administrative roles, which taught me discipline, organization, and a
            professional mindset. </br></br>This background helped me develop strong time management and responsibility early on.
            During college, I started offering freelance tech services, building websites and doing small hardware
            repairs.</br></br> These experiences not only strengthened my skills but also supported me financially while I
            studied.</h3>
